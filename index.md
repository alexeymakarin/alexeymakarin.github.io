Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor at the [Einaudi Institute for Economics and Finance (EIEF)](http://www.eief.it/) in Rome, Italy. My research interests are in political economy, development economics, and applied microeconomics.

I have received Ph.D. in [Economics](http://economics.northwestern.edu/) from [Northwestern University](http://www.northwestern.edu/) in June 2019. Before coming to Northwestern, I received B.A. in Economics from [Higher School of Economics](https://www.hse.ru/en/).
